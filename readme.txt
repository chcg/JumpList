Don't forget to check out settings (main menu -> plugins -> nppjumplist).
If you already had Notepad++ pinned, you'll have to unpin old icon and pin the new one.
If you want to revert back to default jump list, you need to uncheck "Enable NppJumpList" in the settings. Just removing the plugin won't do it.
